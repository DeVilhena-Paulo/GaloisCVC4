# GaloisCVC4

The goal of this project is to formalize Galois Theory on Isabelle/HOL. As a base for this development the library HOL-Algebra is used. Even with fairly complete as a library of elementary algebra, there are still some fundamental results that are missing. So together with its use, a lot of modifications were made.
